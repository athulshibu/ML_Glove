1. Get Accelerometer values for all directions

2. Store them into a file as [x_value,y_value,z_value,command]

3. Combine the 4 files of 4 commands (up, down, left, right). This will be the Training values. 
   Don't forget to mix up their order while combining them.

4. Do the same but for a shorter duration to make the Testing Values. (optional)

5. Make a program to move the mouse by command. Use Pyautogui.

6. Create a Neural Net of 3-10-4 format.

7. Train using Training Values.

8. Test using Testing Values.

9. Mess around with the Neural net until an accuracy of 90% is reached.

10. Test on the actual Microbit.

11. Figure out the LDR and buttons/IRs and stuff

12. Test them all out.

13. Attach them all to a glove and start taking pictures.
